I am a software developer located on the beautiful Island of Mauritius. 
I am passionate about building applications that are scalable and easy to maintain.

This is my personal website. After travelling the world and trying out tonnes of new skills and jobs, 
I decided in 2018 to get back to what I love the most, the IT world. 
This is the site that showcase my journey that started 3 years ago when I decided to consolidate my knowledge of coding and out of the blue do Le Wagon bootcamp and build myself a new stable life doing what I love the most.
