I am a software developer located on the beautiful Island of Mauritius. 
I am passionate about building applications that are scalable and easy to maintain.

This is my personal website. After travelling the world and trying out tonnes of new skills and jobs, 
I decided in 2018 to get back to what I love the most, the IT world. I jumped into the role of an IT Manager for an International Franchise Restaurant called Landshark Bar & Grill that just established on the island.
This is the site that showcase my journey that originally started  {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years ago when I decided to consolidate my knowledge of coding since I was Managing the IT system of the restaurant. 
The following year, after doing some online self taught learning, out of the blue I chose to do Le Wagon bootcamp and build myself a new stable life doing what I love the most.
