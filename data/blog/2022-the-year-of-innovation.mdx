## Ahoy, coding pioneers!

Let’s set sail on the adventurous seas of 2022
* a year brimming with innovation and growth.

As the CTO of a UK-based decentralized VC, my days were a whirlwind of groundbreaking ideas, pushing the boundaries of technological possibilities.
I was able to embrace my passion for coding and innovation, while also sharing my knowledge with the next generation of tech enthusiasts. It was quite a challenge for me as I felt I was not experienced enough to take this role but I was so thrilled and excited to take this challenge.

> The CTO experience

In the beginning, there was only me. I was the only developer and the one responsible of the whole technological aspect of the company. I had to drive the CEO vision and translate everything into a meaningful durable and scalable process that was at the same time convenient for the Budget the company could afford.
Quickly we required more developers and I had to hire and train them. I had to make sure that they were able to understand the vision and the process and that they were able to deliver the expected results.

Our CEO did not wait to start pitching to clients and quickly I had to get the hiring process running while getting the client projects started.
Quickly we evolved from a one man show to 2 Developers. Abubakar was a young and very talented junior. Even though he was limited by the stack and knowledge he had, he trusted my guidance and we quickly started to Push out some nice little MVPs for the potential clients who, to our great pleasure was very satisfied with the service we were providing.

Finally after driving the Team for a full year I stopped as the acting CTO which I felt was not the right role for someone who like diving in code like me. It was not without satisfaction though of leaving behind a team of capable developers that would be able to take over and continue making this company grow. By the time I left we had both Web and Data developers working together to produce quality MVPs for our clients.

> The Le Wagon experience continues...

Teaching at Le Wagon across diverse locations added a new dimension to my journey. From Mauritius to Remote Australia, Europe to Casablanca and Cape Town, sharing the thrill of coding with students from varied backgrounds was an enriching experience that fueled my passion further.
I was happy and proud to be able to share my knowledge and experience with the students and to see them grow and become capable developers. Not only them... me also...
Through this recurring pattern of teaching the same thing over and over again, my knowledge in Web developement deepen and I started developing great communication skills and a certain charisma that I did not have before. It was all just pure pleasure.

But wait, there’s more! Diving into freelance development, crafting an immersive NFT marketplace brand, and constructing an online showcase for luxurious villas in the real estate realm added layers of creativity to my coding canvas.
