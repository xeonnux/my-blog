## Ahoy, coding pioneers!

Let’s set sail on the adventurous seas of 2022
* a year brimming with innovation and growth.

As the CTO of a UK-based decentralized VC, my days were a whirlwind of groundbreaking ideas, pushing the boundaries of technological possibilities.

Teaching at Le Wagon across diverse locations added a new dimension to my journey. From Mauritius to Remote Australia, Europe to Casablanca and Cape Town, sharing the thrill of coding with students from varied backgrounds was an enriching experience that fueled my passion further.

But wait, there’s more! Diving into freelance development, crafting an immersive NFT marketplace brand, and constructing an online showcase for luxurious villas in the real estate realm added layers of creativity to my coding canvas.
