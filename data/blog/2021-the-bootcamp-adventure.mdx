## Hey fellow coding adventurers,

Let’s journey back to 2021
* the year that altered the course of my professional trajectory.

It was the year of the Le Wagon web development bootcamp, an immersive experience that transformed my understanding of code and its boundless possibilities.

The bootcamp, spanning from May to August, was an intensive dive into the depths of programming languages, frameworks, and the art of building applications from scratch. It was an exhilarating yet challenging time, where each line of code penned was a step toward mastery.

But the journey didn’t end there. By September, I found myself donning a new hat—a teacher at Le Wagon. Sharing insights, guiding aspiring developers, and witnessing their "aha" moments became an immensely fulfilling part of my coding saga.
